🚀 Projects Implemented

Here are some NLP projects included or referenced in this repository:

📩 Spam Mail Classifier

Built using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.

Dataset: SMS Spam Collection.

Goal: Classify messages as “Spam” or “Ham”.

💬 Chatbot using NLP and Deep Learning

Intent-based chatbot built using TensorFlow/Keras and NLP preprocessing.

Trained on custom intents JSON data.

🧾 News Headline Classifier

Multiclass classification using Naive Bayes and TF-IDF.

Predicts the news category from headline text.

❤️ Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

Used Word2Vec embeddings + LSTM model.

Classifies tweets as positive, neutral, or negative.

📚 Text Summarization System

Implemented both extractive and abstractive summarization.

Used Hugging Face Transformers (BART/T5 models).

🔎 Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Performed NER using SpaCy.

Extracts names, organizations, locations, etc., from raw text.

📖 Word2Vec Implementation

Trained custom Word2Vec model using Gensim.

Visualized word relationships using t-SNE.
